# HYPER-LAUNCH-PROJECT
This project is a simple, interactive machine learning application built using Python. It classifies Iris flowers into species based on their measurements. The application includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and a user interface for predictions.

---

## âœ¨ Features:

* Loads the Iris dataset (built-in from scikit-learn or as a CSV)
* Handles data conversion and basic checks
* Performs univariate and bivariate analysis with visualization
* Trains classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest)
* Evaluates model performance using classification metrics
* Provides a user interface for real-time prediction using Streamlit
